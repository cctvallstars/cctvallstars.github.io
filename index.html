        Eddy Allen and the CCTV Allstars International collective have been playing around world since 2006. They have toured in, UK, Germany, Czech Republic, Ireland, Holland, Austria, Italy, France, Spain, Mexico, USA, Belgium, The Gambia and Brazil.
      </p>  
      <p>
        Eddy Allen - World Adventurer, Composer and Musician - came up with the concept of having his own musical collective. Where by this extended family of musicians rotate around Eddy's somtimes unconventional gigging schedule.
      </p> 
      <p>
        The members of this international crew only grow in numbers as the guys explore new scenes and avenues of music and culture. Eddy has now based himself in Belgium where he is working with some of the guys from Black Mango band, who are all top musicians of the Belgium music circuit.
      </p>

      <p>
        They are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toni Vitacolonna - Drums</li>
        <li>Peter Delannoye - Trombone</li>
        <li>Sam Joris - Trumpet</li>
        <li>Joppe Bestevaar - Baritone Sax</li>
        <li>Ruben Lamon - Bass</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        They plan to have their first gig with this line up at the start of next year.
      </p> 

      <p>
        Until then...
      </p> 

      <p>
        Eddy Allen and the CCTV Allstars Collective are touring the EU until the end of the year 2014 with upcoming gigs in Belgium, Germany, Holland, Czech Republic, France and the UK.
