<p>Eddy Allen and the CCTV Allstars are an International music-collective that has been playing around the world since 2006. They have toured The UK, Germany, The Czech Republic, Ireland, Holland, Austria, Italy, France, Spain, Mexico, The USA, Belgium, The Gambia and Brazil.</p>

<p>Eddy Allen (world adventurer, composer, musician and self-styled Don Juan) came up with the concept of having his own musical collective whereby an extended family of musicians rotate around Eddy's often busy and always unconventional gigging schedule.</p>

<p>The Allstars create a fusion of Ska, Folk, Rock, Punk, World, Reggae, Funk, Latin and Jazz and present a multicultural approach to their music. Their shows are energetic and exciting and they promise to deliver a rocking performance designed to open your heart, get your head bobbing and your dancing feet moving!</p>

<p>Currently based in Prague and presently recording new music!</p>
<p>EP <em>"Young Free Single"</em> to be released in May 2015.</p>
